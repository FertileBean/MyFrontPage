This is my personal website. It has my portfolio, some active projects, and allows me to test out some stuff.

Things I tested here:
* [DaysLeft](http://alainlou.com/daysleft), a countdown to high school graduation for my school. In the background there's some music that I wrote in imitation of popular EDM producers.
